    <richText>Since the start of the year I&#x2019;ve started to use Twitter more and more to promote the app. I&#x2019;ve added a load of new measures to my own version of the app (including government spending, US crime figures, worldwide health figures etc) and I post to my twitter account from the app. I&#x2019;ve used a website called Twiends to get more followers (currently 6,000) and I&#x2019;ve seen a slight increase in app downloads (averaging between 20 and 25 per week).&#xD;I&#x2019;ve decided to add the app functionality to my website (which you should see here) as, in theory, it should be easier to drive traffic here than get iPhone app downloads! If I can get some reasonable (increasing) traffic through to the site then I&#x2019;ll do a new release of the app with additional measures/metrics and include some of the feedback I have.</richText>
